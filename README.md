# About Slooh Tweaks

## What is this?
Slooh Tweaks is a passion projuct run by one developer and two beta testers
attempting to create a chrome extension for the website [https://app.slooh.com/](url)
to make it more user friendly and customizable, mostly for our classmates who use
the site regularly.

## What is Slooh?

Slooh is a website connected to 8 telescopes, 5 on the Canary Islands and 3 in Chile.
Slooh allows users to observe what the telescope is looking at live, and also allow
users to schedule missions, which select an alloted time where the telescope will point
at and object of the users choosing and take pictures of the object for use. There are 
many other features as well, such as celestial database and quests.

## How Can I help?
Slooh Tweaks is my first Chrome extension, and I am still relatively new to programming, so any assistance with 
rewriting or improving my janky code would be directly appreciated. You can do this by making a pull request
or opening an issue.

## How will this porject continue moving forward?
The project is currently in beta, so we're currently tring to figure out bugs and adding the essential
features. Moving forewards, I plan to add Mozilla support.
